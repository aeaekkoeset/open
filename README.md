## 2017-02-21 - SensorFu External Collaboration

SensorFu has structured their development plans and are now looking at
what will be build in-house, and for can be outsourced.

* Jesse and Jani from <http://remod.fi> visited us.
* [@turmi0](https://github.com/turmi0) introduced the idea of
  [SensorFu](http://www.sensorfu.com/).
* Jesse@Remod and Jani@Remod envisioned a gateway-drug for the SensorFu product,
  as well  as talked about different product ideas.
* Sami@Kielo dropped by to plan Vulmeet and mentioned new investor
  connections. Jesse@Remod tipped off about the latest trend:
  [Investor One Pager](https://www.vcforu.com/exampleonepagers)s. We were
  immediately attracted to the idea.

## 2017-01-31 - SensorFu Kickstart

SensorFu workshop. Kickstarting the R&D. @Turmi0 from SensorFu recapped
alternative tech-paths. @oherrala provided details and opinions. We
ruthlessly picked @ecode's brains as he made the mistake of visiting us.
@evilon and @fenris messed up the whiteboards and asked a lot of questions.

* We reflected the implications of different technical choices to collaboration:
  * in-house development,
  * collaboration with scanabc companies, and
  * collaboration with scanabc partners (F-Solutions, Remod, etc...)
* Sales vectors. Positioning SensorFu tech:
  * Simplified: "I get this problem, and easy to jump on-board"
  * Positioning through long term vision - longer term work as the
    customers have not planned purchases on such product.
  * Familiar: piggybacking with marketing $$$ from
    others, but get distracted with unaligned feature parity requests.
* Killed a hefty amount of alternatives for now, zeroing in on an MVP.

## 2016-11-03

Kielo arranged a failure-themed Tuesday.

* Ari Takanen from Kielo opened the session by listing the typical
  startup challenges
* @evilon from Ääkköset Oy enjoyed a lot talking about his failures in life
  and work.
* Mikko from [Sonolux](http://www.sonolux.fi/) spoke about how to
  burn money to build perfectly built loudspeakers and how he
  dealt with the failures before pivoting for something
  commercially viable.
* Mika Ruostesuo from
  [Ruostesuo Consulting](http://www.ruostesuoconsulting.fi/)
  gave a simple message in his talk: if you haven't failed,
  you haven't tried hard enough.

Later the day we gathered together with the HowNetWorks crew
to plan an awareness campaign about [URI:teller](https://uriteller.io).
